# Technical Assessment: Economist Figure

## The Task

Recreate this figure: ![alt text](http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1872-width/20170415_WOC921.png)

The figure was published online [here](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2017/04/06/a-global-decline-in-smoking-masks-regional-variations-between-the-sexes) by The Economist.

## Submission Checklist
Submit the following:
1. A link to your code (as a GitHub repository) and the finished product. Specifically we want to see:
    - How you obtained the data (it doesn’t need to be the original data but it should be similar!)
    # 1st method (failed)
    I went to the **Supplementary appendix** of the Lancet publication and went to Data sources section. 
A complete list of sources is available from the [GBD 2015 Data Input Sources Tool](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2015/data-input-sources). These data are no longer available on the GHDx.

    # 2nd method
I googled "Smoking prevalence and attributable disease burden" which is part of the title of the [Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)30819-X/fulltext) and went through the links. The 4th result was this [link](https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/gbd-2015-smoking-prevalence-1980-2015) then went to files and downloaded this [zip](https://ghdx.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/record-attached-files/IHME_GBD_2015_SMOKING_PREVALENCE_1980_2015_1.zip). 

2. Answers to the following:
    - What was the most challenging part of this exercise?
The most challenging part of the exercise was figuring out which columns and age groups are the relevant ones to reproduce the plot. Moreover, it was really challenging for me to find the formula of the percentage-point change.
    
    - What took you the longest?
The longest part was figuring out how to calculate the percentage-point change and styling the plot. For the percentage-point change I tried two formulas before finding the right one that reproduce the figure. 
The first one was :
$$
(New Number-OriginalNumber)/OriginalNumber*100
$$
Which can be written as:
$$
((New Number-OriginalNumber)-1)*100
$$

    - What did you enjoy the most?
    Seeing that once you get the right percentage-point change you get almost the same plot.I enjoyed styling the plot and using the  [R color palette](https://bookdown.org/hneth/ds4psy/D-3-apx-colors-basics.html).
    
    - What did you enjoy the least?
    I got frustrated when I didn't find the solution at first and so I had to go back and forth many times.
